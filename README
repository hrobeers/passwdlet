This is a Fork of nicwolff's passwdlet.
It is modified and generates different passwords than nicwolff's version.

  I added password.html, which is a modified copy of nicwolff's password page:
    http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.current.html
    (I couldn't find this page on github)

  passwdlet.uncomp.js contains the uncompressed javascript code used in passwdlet
    You can use http://javascriptcompressor.com/ to compress the js code to one line

All code is released under the BSD license. The original passwdlet code is public domain.
