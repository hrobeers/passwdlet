		<!--<h1>What is this?</h1>
		<p><em>I hate passwords.</em> I mean, I don&#39;t mind having really important ones be made-up and memorized but what about all those e-commerce and community sites that want me to create accounts? I end up using the same password at all of them and then I feel stupid knowing that one SQL Server exploit or disgruntled admin could cost me my whole identity.</p>
		<p>So, this is a little Javascript program that will generate a SHA-1 hash from each site's name. The idea is that you choose one master password to secure all your others, and then generate passwords for each site, server, router, &amp;c. by putting a completely obvious name for that resource in the "Site name" field.</p>
		<p>Then just hit <i>return</i> and copy your new password so you can paste it into whatever site you&#39;re registering at. It&#39;ll be different for every site, and undiscoverable by anyone who doesn&#39;t know your master password &#151; but you can always retrieve it by simply using this form again.</p>
		<p>(Note that all this is done by your browser running the program that's in the source of this page; nothing is passed back to my server. You can make your own local copy of this page, use it off-line, &c.)</p>-->
